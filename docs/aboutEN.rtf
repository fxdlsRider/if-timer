\f1\b0 \
I originally developed the IF-Timer for my own use \'96 as a tool for my daily intermittent fasting practice. If it's also useful for you, feel free to use it.\
The timer combines practical functionality with elements of Stoic philosophy. It's designed to support you in approaching your fasting practice mindfully. The meditations are intended to encourage reflection on your own path. Fasting can mean sacrifice, but it can also help you gain clarity.\

\f0\b Technical Details
\f1\b0 \
The IF-Timer was developed using modern web technologies with support from Claude AI (Anthropic). The complete source code is freely available on GitHub \'96 transparency and openness are important to me.\
