# IF Timer - Progress Log

**Purpose:** Track development progress, decisions, and blockers
**Format:** Newest entries first (reverse chronological)

---

## 📅 2025-10-29 - Foundation Phase

### ✅ Completed

- **Documentation System Setup**
  - Created `docs/` folder structure
  - Written `brainstorming.md` - Complete IST/SOLL analysis
  - Written `architecture.md` - Detailed refactoring plan
  - Written `progress.md` - This work log

- **Analysis**
  - Analyzed current codebase structure
  - Identified main problems (monolithic component)
  - Defined target architecture (clean layers)
  - Created migration roadmap (4 phases)

### 🎯 Current Status

**Branch:** `claude/session-011CUZgavYBZpxkbtU7ZNUhn`
**Phase:** Foundation / Planning
**Next:** Start Phase 1.1 - Extract Utils

### 📊 Code Stats

- **Total Lines in IFTimerFinal.jsx:** 1,624
- **Target after refactoring:** ~50 lines (container)
- **New files to create:** ~30
- **Estimated refactoring time:** 10-14 days

### 💡 Key Decisions

1. **Refactoring Strategy:** Strangler Fig Pattern
   - Reason: Keep app working during refactoring
   - Alternative considered: Big Bang (rejected - too risky)

2. **No TypeScript (for now)**
   - Reason: Focus on structure first
   - Revisit: Maybe in Phase 4

3. **Keep inline styles (for now)**
   - Reason: Not priority
   - Alternative: Consider Tailwind later

### ❓ Open Questions

- [ ] State Management: Context enough oder Zustand?
- [ ] Testing: Jest oder Vitest?
- [ ] Styling: Bleiben wir bei inline oder wechseln zu CSS Modules/Tailwind?
- [ ] Deployment: Vercel bestätigt?

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. Update README.md with project overview
2. Commit all documentation to Git
3. Start Phase 1.1: Extract utils (timeCalculations.js)
4. Create first tests for utils

## 💬 Notes for Future Sessions

**For Claude (or future developers):**

1. **Start here:** Always read this progress log first!
2. **Check brainstorming.md** for vision and goals
3. **Check architecture.md** for refactoring strategy
4. **Update this log** after completing any milestone
5. **Ask questions** if something is unclear

**Current Priority:**
Focus on Phase 1 - Foundation. Extract utils and services first, they're the easiest and provide immediate value (testable code).

**Don't:**
- Don't refactor everything at once
- Don't change functionality while refactoring
- Don't skip tests
- Don't forget to update this log!
